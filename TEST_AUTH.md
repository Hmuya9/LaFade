# ✅ Authentication Fix Applied

## What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Environment variables set in PowerShell (`$env:VAR=value`) don't persist across dev server restarts, causing the "Failed to send email" error.

**Solution**: Created `web/.env.local` file that Next.js automatically loads on startup.

## ✅ File Created

```
web/.env.local
```

Contains all required environment variables:
- ✅ `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - For session encryption
- ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` - For sending magic link emails  
- ✅ `EMAIL_FROM` - Test sender (onboarding@resend.dev)
- ✅ `BARBER_EMAIL` - Your barber account
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` - SQLite database path
- ✅ All Stripe keys

## 🧪 Test Authentication Flow

### 1. Open Barber Login Page
```
http://localhost:3000/barber/login
```

### 2. Click "Send Magic Link"
The form should:
- ✅ Show loading state
- ✅ Submit successfully
- ✅ Redirect to "Check your email" page
- ❌ No more "Failed to send email" error

### 3. Check Your Email
Email sent to: `hmuya@uw.edu`

**Subject**: "Your LaFade magic sign-in link"

**Content**:
```
Sign in to LaFade

[Click here to sign in]

This link expires in 24 hours.
```

### 4. Click the Magic Link
Should redirect to: `http://localhost:3000/barber`

### 5. Verify Dashboard Access
You should see:
- ✅ "Barber Dashboard" page
- ✅ List of your availability slots
- ✅ Form to add new slots
- ✅ Sign out button in navigation

## 🔍 Debugging

If you still get errors, check the terminal output for:

```
⚠️ RESEND_API_KEY is missing - authentication will not work
```

If you see this warning, the `.env.local` file wasn't loaded. Try:

1. **Stop the dev server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Verify the file exists**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Content web/.env.local
   ```
3. **Restart dev server**:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\dev\La Fade\h\LeFade\web"
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📧 Resend Test Mode Limitations

**Current setup**: `EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev`

✅ Works for: `hmuya@uw.edu` (your Resend account email)
❌ Fails for: Any other email address

**Error you'll see for other emails**:
```
You can only send testing emails to your own email address (hmuya@uw.edu)
```

### To Send to Any Email

Follow the instructions in `RESEND_SETUP.md`:
1. Buy a domain (e.g., `lafade.com`)
2. Verify it in Resend dashboard
3. Update `.env.local`:
   ```
   EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@lafade.com
   ```
4. Restart dev server

## ✅ Expected Behavior (Now)

### Barber Login (`hmuya@uw.edu`)
1. Visit `/barber/login`
2. Click "Send Magic Link"
3. ✅ Email sends successfully
4. ✅ Check `hmuya@uw.edu` inbox
5. ✅ Click magic link
6. ✅ Redirected to `/barber` dashboard
7. ✅ Can add/delete availability slots

### Client Login (Any Email)
1. Visit `/client/login`
2. Enter any email
3. Click "Send Magic Link"
4. ⚠️ If using test mode: **Only works if email = `hmuya@uw.edu`**
5. ✅ If using verified domain: Works for any email

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the barber flow** with `hmuya@uw.edu`
2. **Add some availability slots** in the barber dashboard
3. **Visit `/booking`** to see the slots appear
4. **(Optional)** Set up a custom domain in Resend to send to any email

## 🚨 Important: .env.local is Secure

The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore`. It **will not** be committed to git, keeping your secrets safe.

Never commit this file or share it publicly!
