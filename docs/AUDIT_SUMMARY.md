### Diagnostic API Endpoints (Development Only)
- **`src/app/api/dev/session/route.ts`** - Session state inspection
  - Returns current session data and cookie information
  - Guarded by `NODE_ENV !== "production"`
  - Safe for debugging authentication issues

- **`src/app/api/dev/env/route.ts`** - Environment variable presence check
  - Returns boolean flags for key environment variables
  - Masks actual values for security
  - Helps identify missing configuration

- **`src/app/api/dev/ping-auth/route.ts`** - Authentication plumbing check
  - Tests Prisma adapter connectivity
  - Verifies NextAuth table existence
  - Validates database connection

### Diagnostic Scripts
- **`scripts/smoke.ts`** - Comprehensive smoke testing
  - Tests health, availability, booking, and brand endpoints
  - Includes dev endpoints when running locally
  - Provides clear pass/fail results
  - Supports both local and production testing

- **`scripts/diag.ts`** - Detailed diagnostic analysis
  - Checks environment variable presence
  - Analyzes authentication state
  - Tests auth plumbing and database connectivity
  - Provides structured diagnostic output

### Package.json Updates
- **Added scripts**:
  - `diag:local` - Run diagnostic checks against local server
  - `curl:local:health` - Quick health check via curl
  - `curl:local:avail` - Quick availability check via curl
  - Existing `smoke:local` and `smoke:prod` scripts enhanced

## Key Findings from Audit

### Authentication System
- **NextAuth v5** with Email Provider and Prisma Adapter
- **JWT session strategy** (no database sessions)
- **Custom Resend integration** for magic links
- **Case-insensitive role assignment** based on `BARBER_EMAIL`
- **Proper CSRF protection** and cookie management

### Database Schema
- **Dual schema support**: PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for local
- **Comprehensive models**: User, Availability, Appointment, PointsLedger, etc.
- **Proper unique constraints** preventing double booking
- **NextAuth adapter tables** properly configured

### Points System
- **Transactional ledger** with credit/debit operations
- **Atomic booking transactions** with rollback on insufficient points
- **Real-time balance calculation** via aggregation
- **Proper error handling** for insufficient funds

### Stripe Integration
- **Webhook handling** for subscription events
- **Points crediting** for subscriptions (+10 signup, +12 renewal)
- **One-off payment support** for individual appointments
- **Proper signature verification** and error handling

### Availability System
- **Barber-managed slots** with add/delete functionality
- **Real-time booking** with immediate slot removal
- **UTC date handling** for consistent timezone management
- **Caching support** with Redis fallback

## Security Considerations

### Production Guards
- All debug endpoints are disabled in production (`NODE_ENV !== "production"`)
- No sensitive data exposed in diagnostic responses
- Environment variable values are masked in logs

### Authentication Security
- Magic links expire after 24 hours
- CSRF tokens protect against cross-site attacks
- Role-based access control enforced server-side
- JWT tokens are HTTP-only and secure

### API Security
- Input validation via Zod schemas
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
- Webhook signature verification for Stripe

## Testing Capabilities

### Automated Testing
- **Smoke tests** verify core functionality
- **Diagnostic checks** validate configuration
- **Environment validation** ensures proper setup
- **Database connectivity** testing

### Manual Testing
- **Step-by-step guides** for all major flows
- **Error scenario testing** with common issues
- **Production deployment** verification steps
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common problems

### Stripe Testing
- **Webhook simulation** via Stripe CLI
- **Test card scenarios** for payment failures
- **Subscription lifecycle** testing
- **Points crediting** verification

## Environment Requirements

### Local Development
```bash
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_api_key"
EMAIL_FROM="onboarding@resend.dev"
BARBER_EMAIL="hmuya@uw.edu"
```

### Production
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-domain.com"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
RESEND_API_KEY="re_production_key"
EMAIL_FROM="verified@yourdomain.com"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
```

## Usage Instructions

### Running Diagnostics
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run diagnostic checks
npm run diag:local

# Run smoke tests
npm run smoke:local

# Quick health check
npm run curl:local:health
```

### Testing Authentication
1. Visit `/barber/login`
2. Enter barber email
3. Check email for magic link
4. Click link to authenticate
5. Verify access to `/barber` dashboard

### Testing Booking Flow
1. Login as client (non-barber email)
2. Subscribe to get points
3. Visit `/booking`
4. Select barber, date, time
5. Complete booking form
6. Verify points deducted and slot booked
